    S3_SECRET_KEY
    TWITTER_ACCESS
    TWITTER_SECRET
    FACEBOOK_ACCESS
    FACEBOOK_KEY

## Bootstrapping (and using Foreman to run all the things)

Your first time here? Just run:

```
$ bin/setup
```

It will guide you through the basic dependencies needed to run the application.
You can run it, see if it yells at you, fix it... and run it again!

Repeat until all the stuff is in place.

### Environment variables

Edit the file `.env` generated in the project's root dir and add your keys for
twitter and facebook applications.

### PostgreSQL

The setup will create a `config/database.yml`, the user configuration will point
to your current s.o. user.

Edit this file if you need, or if the setup process fail trying to use the
credentials auto generated.

### let's go!

Then start the server with the following command:

```
$ foreman start -f Procfile.development
```

That's it! Just go to <http://localhost:3000>.
